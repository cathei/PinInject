# PinInject ðŸ“Œ
Minimalistic Dependency Injection tool for Unity

## Dependency Injection

## Why PinInject?
* Minimal API & complexity
* No unnecessary overconfiguration
* Anti-patterns are not allowed
* Static API gives you flexibility

## Where is Everything?
PinInject's goal is to be the most minimalistic DI Container available for Unity, with simplest possible API. Because I learned that **People will not use DI unless it is simple**.

Also, Unity's GameObject and Component architecture already provides you `Service Locator Pattern`, which has similiar purpose to `Dependency Injection`.
